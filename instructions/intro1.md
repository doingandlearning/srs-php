# Creating a Spaced Repetition System with PHP

A Spaced Repetition System (SRS) is a proven technique for improving long-term retention of information by scheduling reviews of learned material at increasing intervals. This method leverages the psychological spacing effect, where information is more effectively memorized when reviews are strategically spaced over time. In this project, we will implement an SRS using PHP, enabling users to create, manage, and review flashcards in an optimized way. By combining a structured review schedule with dynamic intervals based on user performance, we can ensure that users reinforce their knowledge efficiently, reducing the time spent on material they already know well while focusing on areas where improvement is needed.

## Steps to Build the Spaced Repetition System

### 1. Set Up the Database
We will begin by creating the necessary database structure to store user data, flashcards, and review schedules. The tables will include:
- `users`: to store user information for multi-user functionality.
- `cards`: to store flashcard data including questions, answers, and review intervals.
- `progress`: to track each user's progress on each card, including review counts and next review date.

### 2. Establish Database Connection
Next, we will establish a connection to the MySQL database using PHP's PDO class. This will enable secure and efficient communication with the database. The connection will be encapsulated in a `Database` class to implement the Singleton pattern, ensuring only one instance of the database connection is used throughout the application.

### 3. Implement the MVC Architecture
To organize the codebase and separate concerns, we will implement the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture.

- **Model**: The model will interact with the database, handling the data for flashcards, user accounts, and review schedules.
- **View**: The view will present data to the user, such as displaying flashcards and progress. We will use basic HTML and CSS to create user-friendly interfaces.
- **Controller**: The controller will act as the intermediary between the model and the view, handling user input, updating the model, and rendering the appropriate views.

### 4. Create the Card System
With the MVC structure in place, we will focus on building the core card system. This includes:
- Adding new cards.
- Displaying cards for review.
- Tracking user performance and updating review intervals dynamically based on the spaced repetition algorithm.

### 5. Add User Authentication (Login)
To support multiple users, we will implement a login and registration system. This will include:
- Secure password storage using PHPâ€™s `password_hash()` function.
- User sessions to manage authentication status.
- Access control to ensure that users can only access their own cards and progress.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, we will build a functional Spaced Repetition System in PHP that supports multiple users and provides an efficient way to manage and review flashcards. The MVC structure will keep the codebase organized, while the user authentication system will ensure personalized experiences for each user.
