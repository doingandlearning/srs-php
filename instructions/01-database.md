In this section, weâ€™ll focus on creating the foundational tables for the Spaced Repetition System. These tables will store data about users, flashcards, and user progress. We will break down each task into separate SQL files so that they can be executed individually using the MySQL viewer.

We will:
1. Create the `cards` table to store flashcard data.
2. Create the `users` table to store user information.
3. Create the `progress` table to track each user's progress with flashcards.

For each task we will have a corresponding SQL file that you will create and execute using the SQL viewer.

The benefit of this approach is that the files can be ran against any future database if you had to migrate.
