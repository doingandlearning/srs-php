In this task, we will build the Card Controller, which is responsible for handling user interactions related to flashcards. The controller will:

- Process form submissions for adding new cards
- Validate user input
- Coordinate with the Card model to persist data
- Handle redirects after successful operations

We'll also create a bootstrap.php file to manage our application's dependencies in a centralized way.

- Step 1: Set Up Dependencies

We're going to gather all of our project wide dependencies into a file called `bootstrap.php` that we'll `require_once` as we enter into the program.

1. **Create bootstrap.php**:
   ```php
   <?php
   // Load essential dependencies
   require_once __DIR__ . '/database.php';
   require_once __DIR__ . '/models/Card.php';
   ```

- Step 2: Create the Card Controller

1. **Create CardController.php**:

   - Create a new file in the `controllers` directory named `CardController.php`
   - This will handle the logic for managing flashcards

2. **Basic Controller Structure**:

   ```php
   <?php

   require_once __DIR__ . '/../bootstrap.php';

   class CardController
   {
       private $cardModel;

       public function __construct($cardModel)
       {
           $this->cardModel = $cardModel;
       }
   }
   ```

- Step 3: Implement Add Card Functionality

1. **Add Method Implementation**:

   ```php
   public function add()
   {
       if (empty($_POST['question']) || empty($_POST['answer'])) {
           throw new InvalidArgumentException('Question and answer are required');
       }

       $question = trim($_POST['question']);
       $answer = trim($_POST['answer']);

       if ($question === '' || $answer === '') {
           throw new InvalidArgumentException('Question and answer are required');
       }

       $this->cardModel->addCard($question, $answer);

       return $this->redirect('list.php');
   }

   protected function redirect($location)
   {
       header("Location: " . $location);
       exit();
   }
   ```

### Detailed Explanation

#### Dependencies

- The controller uses `bootstrap.php` to load required dependencies
- Dependencies include the database connection and Card model

#### Controller Design

- **Dependency Injection**: The controller accepts a Card model in its constructor
  - This makes the controller more testable and loosely coupled
- **Single Responsibility**: Each method handles one specific task

#### Add Method Features

1. **Input Validation**:

   - Checks if question and answer are present in POST data
   - Trims whitespace from inputs
   - Validates that inputs aren't empty after trimming
   - Throws InvalidArgumentException for invalid inputs

2. **Data Processing**:

   - Uses the Card model to add the card to the database
   - Handles the database interaction through the model layer

3. **Redirection**:
   - Redirects to list.php after successful addition
   - Uses a protected redirect method for better testability

#### Testing Considerations

- The protected redirect method allows for easy mocking in tests
- Constructor injection enables easy substitution of the Card model in tests
- Input validation can be thoroughly tested
- No direct database interaction in the controller

### Usage Example

```php
// Create dependencies
$cardModel = new Card();

// Create controller
$controller = new CardController($cardModel);

// Handle form submission
try {
    $controller->add();
} catch (InvalidArgumentException $e) {
    // Handle validation errors
    echo $e->getMessage();
}
```

This implementation follows SOLID principles and provides a robust foundation for managing flashcards in the application.
